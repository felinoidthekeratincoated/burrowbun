Changes since last push:
 - Map has been split into World and Map. World generates a world and saves it
to a file, and Map reads a world file and stores the info in memory so it can
be displayed.
 - Added a TileType NONE, mainly for debugging purposes

TODO: Make Map use SpaceInfo instead of Tile*

Known bugs:
 - Making a mountain does it wrong.

Known "features": 
 - Both pressing and releasing a key accelerates the player in the same
   direction
 - If the player has multiple keys for a movement, holding two of them down
   will accelerate the player twice as fast

Changes since last push:
 - Made a struct to hold map information, TODO: make a class that has easy access to a 2d array of this struct, and make Map use that instead
 - make now incudes debugging information by default

Fixed bugs:
 - When generating the world, canyon layers don't go all the way across 
    (the program was writing to the wrong memory)

Known bugs:
 - There's a few memory-management related bugs valgrind finds.

Known "features": 
 - Both pressing and releasing a key accelerates the player in the same
   direction
 - If the player has multiple keys for a movement, holding two of them down
   will accelerate the player twice as fast

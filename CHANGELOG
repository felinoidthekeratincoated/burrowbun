 - Added a changelog.
 - Made the map once again use tiles instead of const tiles
 - Added an SDL_Texture field to the Tile class, now that they aren't const
   so the texture wouldn't have to be passed for construction
 - Moved Tile's height and width fields to the WindowHandler class
 - Added red, blue, and green fields to the tile class for color keying, which
   turned out to be unnecessary because SDL understands translucent images
 - Added a function to render the map, which currently makes unnecessary
   rectangles because I didn't realize I don't need to handle cases where the
   tile is partially off the screen separately
 - Added a 3D vector of rectangles, which can actually just be a 2D vector
 - Added a prototype of a function for unloading tiles to switch maps

Known Bugs:
 - When TILE_WIDTH and TILE_HEIGHT aren't 20, a horizontal and vertical line
   of not rendering any tiles show up

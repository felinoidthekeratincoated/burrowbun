Changes since last push:
 - Reorganized code, so hopefully it can be slightly more readable
 - Replacing isColliding with interects as a method of the Rect struct seems to have fixed the bug? It's still possible to enter a block, but I think that's
only because I haven't implemented corner collisions yet.

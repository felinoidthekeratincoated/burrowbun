Changes since last push:
 - The player now stores which keys do what in a struct instead of a bunch of vectors. I'm not sure that it's better than the eventHandler just storing the info, though.

TODO: make a class that has easy access to a 2d array of this SpaceInfo, and make Map use that instead

Known "features": 
 - Both pressing and releasing a key accelerates the player in the same
   direction
 - If the player has multiple keys for a movement, holding two of them down
   will accelerate the player twice as fast

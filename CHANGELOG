Changes since last push:
 - Added an inventory. There aren't yet any items to put in it, but it does
appear and disappear as it should when the key to access it is pressed.

Known "features":
 - The strenth of gravity is independent of the world.
 - Things that move multiple tiles per second won't collide as if they were moving in a straight line. The best way to solve this may be to not allow anything to move that fast, possibly via multiple updates between renderings.
 - The spawn point sometimes puts the player on top of dirt. Spawning should be changed so it destroys any tiles in the way.

Known bugs:
 - Apparently the player can fit in gaps that they can't escape.

Soon to come (though likely not very soon):
 - Items
 - More types of tiles
 - Trees!
 - Better map generation
 - Instead of storing the health of every single tile on the map, I should just have a list of the ones that have been damaged.
 - hud
 - Make the spaceInfo class just store a tiletype, not a Tile*, and use it as
the index of the Tile*

Changes since last push:
 - Changed movement so it's actually reasonable. Also made movables use a struct with a double for x and y instead of having a copy of each variable for x and for y.

TODO: Make Map use SpaceInfo instead of Tile*

Known bugs:
 - Moving up and down looks wierd.

Fixed bugs:
 - Making a mountain does it wrong. 

Fixed "features": 
 - Both pressing and releasing a key accelerates the player in the same
   direction
 - If the player has multiple keys for a movement, holding two of them down
   will accelerate the player twice as fast

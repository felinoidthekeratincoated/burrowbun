Changes since last push:
 - Removed color keying, since transparency in the image is just better
 - Removed the unnecessary rectangles to draw from, since SDL can handle 
   things that are partially off the screen just fine. This also seems to have 
   fixed the bug.
 - findCamera now returns a camera smaller than worldsize, even if worldsize
   is smaller than screensize. This means TILE_WIDTH and TILE_HEIGHT can be 
   set to 1 to view most of the map, though it's pretty slow

Known bugs:
 - When generating the world, canyon layers don't go all the way across

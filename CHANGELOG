Changes since last push:
 - moved TILEWIDTH and TILE_HEIGHT from WindowHandler to main
 - The window is now resizable.
 - moved #includes from .hh files to .cc files wherever possible
 - Added include guards
 - Added movement by arrow keys and wasd

Known bugs:
 - The rightmost and bottommost rows of tiles sometimes? aren't rendered
 - When generating the world, canyon layers don't go all the way across

Known "features": 
 - Both pressing and releasing a key accelerates the player in the same
   direction
 - If the player has multiple keys for a movement, holding two of them down
   will accelerate the player twice as fast

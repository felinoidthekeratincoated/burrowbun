Changes since last push:
 - Edited README to actually maybe be useful.
 - Stepping up a tile now takes more tha none frame.
 - One press of space now corresponds to one jump.
 - Movement and gravity was adjusted.

Known "features":
 - Holding down space means that it will attempt to jump whenever possible, 
rather than doing the "one press of space corresponds to one jump" that can feel more natural (in Terraria, the difference between equipping or not equipping a frog leg). - fixed
 - It is possible to step up a tile while jumping, to go up extra fast - fixed
 - The strenth of gravity is independent of the world.
 - Things that move multiple tiles per second won't collide as if they were moving in a straight line. The best way to solve this may be to not allow anything to move that fast, possibly via multiple updates between renderings.
 - The spawn point sometimes puts the player on top of dirt. Spawning should be changed so it destroys any tiles in the way.

Known bugs:
None!

Soon to come (though likely not very soon):
 - More types of tiles
 - Trees!
 - Better map generation
 - Fixed collision detection - mission accomplished, until I add platforms
 - A more deliberate framerate
 - Better values for movement fields - done for now
 - Some proper way of storing information about a sprite animation?
 - Instead of storing the health of every single tile on the map, I should just have a list of the ones that have been damaged.
 - hud
 - inventory
